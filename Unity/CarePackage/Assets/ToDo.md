Hi Scott,  Cathy and I played with the care packages today and learned a lot.  First of all, it‚Äôs terrific. So satisfying even to watch the boxes open.  I think families will play for a long time.  We did have some ideas for signs and tweaks that I want to share, knowing you and Joy spoke earlier .  Here are my notes:
Big screen: 


Can we add the care package logo to the door?
Can the label on the box be bigger?
Can the stuff be bigger?

* * *



Can the items stay on the scanner screen until the door closes?
  Wait new boxes.

Can we add thank you when the door closes?
  Small screen with door.



Can we slow down the catch and release animation?
Can you slow down the opening of the box?
Can we slow down the moving conveyor - pattern is a lot visually.
   Try to gain a few seconds.







Filling station:

* Can we add the care package symbol to the box graphic on the screen?

* Overall, we want to use the care package symbol in more places.


Can we add text to the screen? The box and symbols are good, but we think we need some text too.
  * A few words on instruction graphics.


Can we have a max number of items? For example, can the box stop filling/close after 10 items?
  * Soft cap at 10.




Add sign to the front ‚Äúwhat do you want to send‚Äù with a grid of all the choices

I think that is all for the animation, computer parts. We had some ideas about floor graphics, or indicators and some other physical wayfinding adds in the room.
It‚Äôs really great to see it running. And it was easy to start, once I new what ‚Äòplug in‚Äô meansü§™

Done

*   Add "TO" label.
*   Joy will work on signage.
